# CarTracker
The goal with our product is to provide a graphical representation of data that can be interesting for the user. The reason why we want to develop such a services is to provide a general overview over how we use the car and to make the user aware of their own CO2 emissions, how many hours they have spent in the car, and so on. The product is mainly meant for the car owner, or driver, but can also be used by others, for example passengers.
